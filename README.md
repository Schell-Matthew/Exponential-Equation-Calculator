# Exponential-Equation-Calculator
This project calculates an exponential equation from a given table of coordinate points, exponential growth, and exponential decay. 
If you have any questions or want to tell me how much of a great program this is, you can email me at matthewschell2007@icloud.com. Enjoy!


How to download:
Just do a simple "git clone https://github.com/TurboDynamics/Exponential-Equation-Calculator.git" in the terminal and you should be good to go

How to run:
Python 3+ required. Anything older will not work!!!
python3 main.py


How to use:

If you want to create an exponential equation, pass the table of points in the format x, y | x, y | etc....
Examples: 

  1. 0, 2 | 1, 4 | 2, 8 | 3, 16 | 4, 32
  
  2. -2, 3 | -1, 9 | 0, 27 | 1, 81
  
  3. 2, 4 | 1, 2 | 0, 1 | -1, 1/2 | -2, 1/4
  
  
If you want to calculate exponential growth or decay, just pass the y-intercept, growth/decay rate, and the time in any units.
